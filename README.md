# GIKT

The code is related to the paper `GIKT: A Graph-based Interaction Model for Knowledge Tracing` published at ECML-PKDD 2020 [Paper in arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05991).


## Datasets
You can download the preprocessed dataset: [download](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i317xy6ys6csnbw/AAAwGTvrb-mXtymuS6JgOoWpa?dl=0)

If you want to process the datasets by yourself, you can download them by the following links:

You should create a folder named `data` for datasets. Besides, folders `checkpoint` and `logs` are also needed to create for saving model and log in our experiments.

## Environment Requirement

python == 3.6.5

tensorflow == 1.12.0

numpy == 1.15.2

## Examples to run the model
